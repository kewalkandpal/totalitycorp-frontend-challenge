#### About project
This project display a variety of products with product image,name,price and add to cart buttons. In this project user can filter products by category,price(low to high) or rating.
In this project i have implemented a cart section to display the added products where user can increase,decrease and remove the products. and implemented a checkout process Where all payment details can be shown to the user.

#### Approach
- In this project i have used redux to mange state and centralizing app data in one place so that all the application components can easly access this data. 
- In this project i used google firebase for user authentication like user registration and login.
